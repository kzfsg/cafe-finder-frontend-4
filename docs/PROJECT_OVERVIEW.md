# Cafe Finder - Project Overview

## Project Description

Cafe Finder is a comprehensive social cafe discovery application that connects coffee enthusiasts with great cafes while building a community around cafe culture. The platform combines location-based discovery with social networking features, allowing users to find, review, bookmark, and share their favorite cafe experiences.

## Vision & Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Discovery**: Help users find cafes that match their preferences (wifi, power outlets, noise level, etc.)
- **Community**: Build a social network of cafe enthusiasts who share recommendations and experiences
- **Quality**: Maintain high-quality cafe data through user submissions and community moderation
- **Accessibility**: Provide an intuitive, responsive experience across web and mobile platforms

### Target Users
1. **Regular Users**: Coffee enthusiasts, remote workers, students looking for study spaces
2. **Merchants**: Cafe owners who want to showcase their establishments and connect with customers
3. **Admins**: Platform moderators who manage submissions and maintain content quality

## Core Features

### Cafe Discovery
- **Search & Filter**: Find cafes by location, amenities (wifi, power outlets), atmosphere, price range

- **Detailed Profiles**: Comprehensive cafe information with photos, amenities, and user reviews
- **Interactive Maps**: Integration with mapping services for directions and location context

### Social Features
- **User Profiles**: Personalized profiles with activity history and social connections
- **Following System**: Follow other users to see their cafe discoveries and reviews
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time feed of bookmarks, reviews, and interactions from followed users
- **Reviews & Ratings**: Boolean rating system (positive/negative) with detailed comments
- **Voting System**: Community-driven upvote/downvote system for cafe quality

### Content Management
- **User Submissions**: Community-driven cafe submissions with photo uploads
- **Admin Approval**: Moderated submission process to maintain data quality
- **Image Management**: Multiple photos per cafe with automatic optimization
- **Merchant Dashboard**: Business owners can manage their cafe listings

### User Engagement
- **Bookmarking**: Save favorite cafes for easy access

- **Social Discovery**: Find new cafes through friend recommendations and popular trends

## Technology Stack

### Web Application (Current)
- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: Mantine for consistent, accessible components
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side navigation
- **State Management**: Context API for auth + TanStack Query for server state
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth interactions
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + Mantine theme system

### Mobile Application (Planned)
- **Framework**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for native navigation patterns
- **UI Library**: NativeBase or React Native Elements (Mantine equivalent)
- **State Management**: Same patterns - Context + React Query
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated (Framer Motion equivalent)
- **Platform Features**: Native camera, location services, push notifications

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Supabase for all backend functionality
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (managed by Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password + social logins
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for cafe images
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **API**: Auto-generated REST API and GraphQL from Supabase

### Development Tools
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety across all platforms
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub for collaboration
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (web), App Store/Play Store (mobile)

## Architecture Highlights

### Service Layer Architecture
- **Abstraction**: Complete abstraction of backend operations through service files
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of RLS policy violations and network issues
- **Timeout Protection**: Built-in timeouts prevent hanging requests
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Support for data migration and backward compatibility

### Data Management
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Data Transformation**: Consistent transformation between backend and frontend formats
- **Caching Strategy**: React Query for intelligent data caching and synchronization
- **Offline Support**: Graceful degradation when network is unavailable

### Security & Privacy
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level security policies for data access control
- **Authentication Flow**: Secure authentication with session management
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can control visibility of their activities and profiles
- **Data Validation**: Client and server-side validation for data integrity

## User Workflows

### New User Journey
1. **Account Creation**: Choose account type (regular/merchant) and complete profile
2. **Onboarding**: Location permission, initial preferences setup
3. **Discovery**: Browse local cafes, view popular recommendations
4. **Engagement**: Bookmark favorites, leave first review, follow other users
5. **Community**: Participate in social features, submit new cafes

### Daily Usage Patterns
- **Morning**: Check nearby cafes for work/study locations
- **Social**: Browse friends' activity feed for new discoveries
- **Exploration**: Use map view to find cafes in new areas
- **Contribution**: Leave reviews, upload photos, submit new cafes

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Daily/Monthly Active Users
- Session duration and frequency
- Social interactions (follows, reviews, bookmarks)
- Content creation (submissions, photos, reviews)

### Content Quality
- Cafe submission approval rates
- User-generated content volume
- Review sentiment and helpfulness
- Image quality and variety

### Community Growth
- User acquisition and retention rates
- Social network density (follows/followers ratio)
- Geographic coverage and expansion
- Merchant adoption and engagement

## Technical Considerations

### Scalability
- **Database**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
- **Images**: CDN delivery with automatic optimization
- **Caching**: Multi-layer caching strategy for performance
- **API**: Rate limiting and efficient pagination

### Cross-Platform Strategy
- **Shared Business Logic**: Services layer works identically on web and mobile
- **Design Consistency**: Unified design system across platforms
- **Feature Parity**: Core features available on all platforms
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Platform-specific features where appropriate

### Future Enhancements
- **AI Recommendations**: Machine learning for personalized cafe suggestions
- **Advanced Search**: Natural language search and AI-powered filters
- **Business Analytics**: Merchant dashboard with insights and analytics
- **Integration**: Third-party integrations (Google Maps, social media)
- **Monetization**: Premium features, merchant subscriptions, advertising
